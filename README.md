My roll in this project was the understudy to my professor.

CMP343 group project undertaken by the Software Engineering class at Saint Joseph's College, Term 141

The main area that I focused on was on the front-end and making the various forms to our overall SPA.

This project was during our Pre-Github days where our professor was the only one using Github at the time.
